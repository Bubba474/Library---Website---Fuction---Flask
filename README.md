# 📚 Flask Library Management System

A lightweight and functional web application built with **Flask** and **SQLite**, designed to manage a small library system. It supports user registration, login, book lending, returns, reservations, admin reporting, and data export in **PDF** and **Excel** formats.

## 🧪 Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-library-system.git
cd flask-library-system
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the app:**

```bash
python app.py
```

5. **Access in your browser:**

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## 🔐 Admin Access

To create an admin user, go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/criar_admin
```

*(Only available when `debug=True` in `app.py`)*

---

## 📤 Exporting Data

* `/exportar_excel` → Download history as Excel (`.xlsx`)
* `/exportar_pdf` → Download history as PDF (`.pdf`)

*Only accessible to admins.*

---

## 📌 Notes

* CPF validation is format-based only (11 digits).
* Email sending is mocked – just prints to console.
* Books are stored in-memory (`LIVROS` dictionary), not in the database.

---

## 📅 Future Improvements (Suggestions)

* Store books in the database with models
* Add due dates and overdue tracking
* Enable real email notifications
* Add pagination to historical records
* Add search by CPF or book title in history
